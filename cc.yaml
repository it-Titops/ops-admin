## On-Prem --> IT Center
    Datacenter -- > Servers
                    Routers
                    Switches
                    Power Cooling systems


## Cloud Computing 
  -- DataCenter but in a remote locations and 
  its given to you on demand and available at scale
  It must not be publicly owned, it can also be Private  


## Questions: Hybrid Cloud/Enviroments <--> 
  You have some infrastrasructure in the Cloud and some on prem

## What Is Cloud Computing?
  Cloud computing is the practice of storing and 
  accessing your data from remote servers(data-centers). 
  Cloud computing is of various types, 
  and to understand it completely, 
  you should first know the different categories of Cloud:-

  Public Cloud:
  This is the most common type of Cloud. Here, the servers(data centers) are shared between multiple clients. Eg of major public cloud providers: Amazon, Google, Microsoft, many more can possibly share the servers between them

  Private Cloud:
  A private cloud is operated by a single user(client), a closed group of users or a single organization. The services and security protocols are also updated frequently. Eg: Intranet, VMware.

  Hybrid Cloud:
  Hybrid as the name means, is a mixture of both Public and Private Cloud. You can also think of it this way, having a public cloud for storing your data accessible to the public, and private cloud for running your production lines and legacy applications.

  NB:
  Cloud Computing often referred to as “The Cloud” is basically delivery of compute services over the Cloud (Internet). Cloud computing consists of servers, networks, storage, databases, analytics tool, software, and programming platform. The cloud computing service can be divided into three models commonly known as:-


  ** SaaS (Software as a Service)
  ** PaaS (Platform as a Service)
  ** IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)


### Process of having your companies IT infrastructure highly available, at scale and on demand

IT infrastructure: -- Physical Computers ( it going to be used to create virtual machines or containers), Hard Drives (storage), Input and Output Devices (Mouse, Monitor, keyboards etc), RAM (Memory), CPU (Processor), Networking, OS (virtualization Software)

Highly available: -- always reachabl (e.g instead of having a laptop with 1; 16GB or RAM, I will have a laptop with 2; 8 GB or RAM) -- > creating a redundant IT infra; we want to have two or three replicas of the same thing

At Scale: whereever in a large quantity, you want that if I need 10 virtual machines from you in 10 different locations, you should provide them

On Demand: when ever I need it, 10 servers today


###
  Type of enviroments, that are considered infra
    - Physical Computer or Device
    - Virtual machines: It a device does not physically control the resouces its running on
    - Containers: light weight virtual machines
    - Serverless: Virtual machines or Containers on demand and at scale


  Important things you need for your physical computer to come on
    ** Memory <--> RAM
    ** Processor
    ** Battery or Power
    ** Network Interface Card
    ** Graphics Card 
    ** Operating System
    ** Storage <--> ROM
    


    ! What are the things that I need to create a virtual machine
      * Physical Machines
      * Virtualization Software
      -- There are two types of virtualization Softwares
      ** Type 1 hypervisors --> Installed on bare metal 
      ** Type 2 hypervisors --> Hosts operating system 


  virtulization: it is a type of technology, that enables us to have virtual copies of otherwise physical computer resources

  Three types of containirization softwares:
