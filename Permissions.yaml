# Organizations Repository roles / Permissions

        You can give organization members, outside collaborators, and teams of people different levels of access to repositories owned by an organization by assigning them to roles.
        Choose the role that best fits each person or team's function in your project without giving people more access to the project than they need.

    From least access to most access, the roles for an organization repository are:
      
        *Read Recommended for non-code contributors who want to view or discuss your project.
        *Triage Recommended for contributors who need to proactively manage issues and pull requests without write access.
        *Write Recommended for contributors who actively push to your project.
        *Maintain Recommended for project managers who need to manage the repository  without access to sensitive or destructive actions.
        *Admin Recommended for people who need full access to the project, including sensitive and destructive actions like managing security or deleting a repository.
